# Disinformation Awareness App

This project is a social experiment tool designed to demonstrate the ease of generating disinformation. By creating AI-generated articles with a watermark and disclaimer, it aims to show how easily people can overlook warnings and accept information at face value if it appears credible. Below are additional feature ideas and project details that could add depth and utility to the app.

## Features

### Core Features

1. **AI-Generated Articles**: Users enter prompts, and the app generates realistic articles based on those prompts. All articles contain a **watermark** and **disclaimer** to indicate they are fake.
2. **Headline and Tone Options**: Users can choose different article tones (e.g., sensational, academic) to see how language changes impact credibility.
3. **Bias Mode**: Users can select biases (e.g., political, cultural) to explore how subtle language shifts can target specific audiences.

### Additional Features

1. **Interactive Disinformation Awareness**:
    - **Pop-up Tips**: Display “Did you know?” facts about misinformation periodically while users interact with generated articles.
    - **Awareness Quiz**: After reading an article, prompt users with questions to test their ability to detect disinformation cues.
2. **Educational Features**:
    - **Case Study Library**: A curated collection of real-world disinformation examples. After reading generated articles, users can explore these case studies to understand the effects of similar tactics.
    - **Role Play as Fact-Checker**: Allow users to switch roles between fact-checker and disinformation creator to learn techniques from both sides.
3. **Campaign Mode**:
    - **Disinformation Campaign Simulation**: Users can simulate an entire campaign, seeing how repeated exposure to themes builds perceived authenticity.
    - **Leaderboard for Detection Scores**: Encourage user engagement by adding a leaderboard to track high scores in disinformation detection.
4. **Real-Time Disinformation Themes**:
    - Track popular user-generated topics within the app to show real-time trends in misinformation. This feature highlights which themes are most prone to manipulation based on recent real-world events.
5. **Customization for Realism**:
    - **User-Guided Article Customization**: Users can add fictional quotes, sources, and images to see how these elements affect perceived credibility.
6. **Virtual Newsroom Mode**:
    - **Collaborative Generation**: Allow multiple users to work together to generate a series of articles, simulating a “newsroom” environment. Users can then see how a consistent storyline can reinforce trustworthiness, even if content is fake.
7. **Bias and Audience Awareness Mode**:
    - **Reader Bias Simulation**: Let users select an intended audience or bias and see how small changes in wording and focus can significantly alter perceptions.

## Ethical Considerations

-   **Transparency**: Display a permanent disclaimer about the educational intent of the app.
-   **User Consent for Interaction Tracking**: Obtain explicit consent from users for tracking interaction data, especially for metrics related to detection of fake content.
-   **Educational Positioning**: This app is a tool to understand and combat misinformation, with a focus on user learning and awareness.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React/Next.js
-   **Backend**: Next.js
-   **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT API
-   **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS or styled-components

## Project Goals

-   **Showcase AI & Full-Stack Skills**: The app demonstrates AI integration, backend management, and frontend presentation, making it an impactful resume addition.
-   **Highlight Social Awareness**: This project illustrates a modern tech issue with clear social implications, setting you apart as someone who understands the power and risks of technology.

## Additional Notes

This project balances technical prowess with social responsibility, making it a powerful tool for showcasing both your technical skills and your social awareness. Good luck, and feel free to add or adjust these features as you go!
